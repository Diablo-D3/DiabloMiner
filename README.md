# Warning #
DiabloMiner is a command line program. This means you need to open a terminal
(cmd.exe, Terminal.app/iTerm2, xterm, etc) and run the program with the proper
arguments from there.

You __require__ hardware that is capable of running OpenCL.

# MacOSX Warning #
Apple's OpenCL drivers often exhibit strange bugs.

If DiabloMiner is displaying warnings about `CL_INVALID_WORK_GROUP_SIZE`, add
`-w 64` to your arguments.

# How to download #
__[Binary download here](http://adterrasperaspera.com/DiabloMiner.zip)__

This download is always kept up to date with the newest version of the source.

# How to build #
DiabloMiner requires the SDK for Java 6.0 or higher installed, as well as
Maven 3.x. Maven will download the rest of the dependencies.

DiabloMiner uses launch4j to build Windows binaries. launch4j requires and
partially includes a build chain for Win32. launch4j cannot be ran on any
64-bit only version of OSX (10.6 and up) and is difficult to run on Windows.

DiabloMiner's git repo does not contain binaries, so if you want to build
DiabloMiner from source, heed the above warning and run `mvn package`.

# How to use #
# Single pool and solo mining #
`./DiabloMiner-YourOS.sh -u username -p password -o host -r port`

or

`./DiabloMiner-YourOS.sh -l http://username:password@host:port`

For solo mining, your host is `localhost` your port is `8332`, and your
username and password is what you set in your bitcoind's `bitcoin.conf`.
See bitcoin documentation for further information on how to enable the RPC
API.

## Multiple pools ##
`./DiabloMiner-YourOS.sh -u username1,username2 -p password1,password2
 -o host1,host2 -r port1,port2`

DiabloMiner supports unlimited pools and will switch to the next pool on
connection failure and return to the first pool every 60 minutes.

# Optimization #
## MacOSX on any hardware ##
It is recommended you use the default settings, see also the MacOSX warning
above.

## Nvidia hardware on any OS ##
It is recommended you use the default settings, however if your desktop is
lagging badly try adding `-f 120`, `-f 180`, or `-f 240`.

## Intel hardware on any OS ##
DiabloMiner has not been tested on Intel GPUs. Default is most likely correct.

# Command line arguments #
* __-u, -p, -o, -r__ Username, password, host, port
* __-l__ Fully fledged URL, ex: http://username:password@host:port/
* __-x__ Proxy, ex: host:port<:username:password>
* __-d__ Debug output
* __-D__ Use specific devices. Default is all.
* __-f__ FPS, controls how many kernel executions a second happen, default is 30
* __-w__ Controls OpenCL workgroup size, default is hardware detected maximum
* __-v__: Change manual SIMD parallel alignment.
 * -v 1: The same as off/single hash, and is the default (`uint`)
 * -v 2 through 16: Tries more than one hash via SIMD (`uint2` through `uint16`)
 * -v 1,1, etc: Non-SIMD interleaving on top of SIMD, faster on a very small
   minority of hardware (`-v 2,1` is faster than `-v 2` on some Radeon VLIW5)
